        <h2>We don't make updates. You do.</h2>
        <p>Have you ever been in the middle of work, or gaming, and all of the sudden your computer screamed at you saying it's about to update?</p>
        <p>That won't happen with ShiftOS. You upgrade exactly what features you want. But.... there's a price to pay...</p>

        <h2>Take it even further.</h2>
        <p>Know Lua or C#? We've got ya covered. ShiftOS is an amazing development environment. Not only can you customize it to look however you want, but you can code your own features and applications. Then, sell them to other Shifters, and pocket the cash.</p>
        <p>Or, if you want to go even further, we're <a href="http://github.com/shiftos-game/ShiftOS">open-source</a>! We accept contributions.</p>
